I am a data scientist and software engineer in the Department of Biomedical Informatics & Data Science at Yale University, where I have the great privilege of working with Qingyu Chen and Hua Xu. I hold a Master's degree in Physics and a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Kentucky, where I was fortunate to be advised by Ramakanth Kavuluru during my second Master's.

My research focuses on advancing AI in healthcare, particularly in:

- **End-to-end information extraction**
- **Ophthalmology-specific (multimodal) LLMs**
- **RAG and agent systems in healthcare**
- **AI development leveraging real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE), such as the OMOP Common Data Model**
